# Winter-2021_
Python Scripts for class, projects, research, etc
This repository contains code from my thermodynamics class (CHE330), computational methods class (CHE220), current research (Winter workbook 2021), and a digitized rasprberry pi temperature and humidity sensor project from summer 2020 (experiment 1 graph, realdigitfinder, and humidity). Please note I am still working in the research workbook. As of now, I am trying to parse drug like molecules and return functional groups of certain sub structures in SMILES strings. I am using a library called rdkit to do this, and I have borrowed some of the code from http://www.rdkit.org/docs/Cookbook.html. The temperature and humidity sensor project was done with the help of stack exchange (working out a kink in realdigitfinder) and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjNyCeqcq4g&list=LL&index=19 (this was the basis for the humidity code). Other than that, this is all original code I have written. Thank you for taking the time to read through my work, best,
